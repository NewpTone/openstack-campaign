# OpenStack-campaign

A tool for deploy openstack on Grid'5000 (Tutorial available [here](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/OpenStack))

## Grid'5000

[Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/) a scientific instrument designed to support experiment-driven research in all areas of computer science related to parallel, large-scale or
distributed computing and networking.

## OpenStack

[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org) OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

## Puppetlabs
[Puppetlabs](http://www.puppetlabs.org) Puppet Open Source is a flexible, customizable framework available under the Apache 2.0 license designed to help system administrators automate the many repetitive tasks they regularly perform. As a declarative, model-based approach to IT automation, it lets you define the desired state – or the “what” – of your infrastructure using the Puppet configuration language. Once these configurations are deployed, Puppet automatically installs the necessary packages and starts the related services, and then regularly enforces the desired state. In automating the mundane, Puppet frees you to work on more challenging projects with higher business impact.
